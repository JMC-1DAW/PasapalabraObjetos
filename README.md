This is a game called "Pasapalabra".
The game asks you a bunch of questions and you have to answer them with a single word each question. 
The word must start with the letter it was assigned to the question, which is also informed to you before the question.
You can answer with what you think is the correct answer or answer with "Pasapalabra" for the question to be skipped.
The questions skipped with "Pasapalabra" will be asked later after the first bunch of questions were asked.
It will ask the questions until you answer all of them either correctly or not.

It will ask you one question for each letter of the alphabet.
They won't be always the same questions over and over so don't get too confortable.

I hope it is fun, but I doubt it honestly.


HOW IT WORKS

When you start the game, the game gets 26 questions, one for each letter of the alphabet.
The game chooses randomly between all "Question Bundles" it has available now.
It chooses randomly a bundle for each question, so the result will be a mix of questions from all the bundles.
If you answer correclty or not, the game will mark the question as answered and it won't ask that question again.
If you skip the question writing "Pasapalabra" as the answer, the game will save it to ask it later.
The game won't stop until you answer all the questions and after that it will give you the resuls.
