This is a game called "Pasapalabra".
The game asks you a bunch of questions and you have to answer them with a single word each question. 
The word must start with the letter it was assigned to the question, which is also informed to you before the question.
You can answer with what you think is the correct answer or answer with "Pasapalabra" for the question to be skipped.
The questions skipped with "Pasapalabra" will be asked later after the first bunch of questions were asked.
It will ask the questions until you answer all of them either correctly or not.

Now the game has just 5 questions, one for each vowel of the alphabet, but soon there will be more letters.
My plan is adding at least one question for each letter of the alphabet, counting vowels and consonants.

I hope it is fun, but I doubt it honestly.
